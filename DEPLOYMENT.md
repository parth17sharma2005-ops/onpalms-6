## üìù After Deployment - Update footer.php

Once your Render deployment is live, update the API URL in your `footer.php` file:

```javascript
// Replace this line in footer.php:
const API_URL = 'http://localhost:5002'; // OLD

// With your new Render URL:
const API_URL = 'https://palms-chatbot-tofu.onrender.com'; // NEW
```

Or use your actual Render URL if you named it differently.

## üß™ Testing the Deployment

1. **Test the API endpoint**: 
   - Visit `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/` - should show the chat interface
   
2. **Test chat functionality**:
   - Send a message and verify bot responses
   - Check that TOFU lead scoring is working
   
3. **Test demo form submission**:
   - Request a demo through the chat
   - Fill out the form with a business email
   - Verify data appears in your Google Sheet with all 9 columns:
     - Timestamp, Name, Email, Phone, Source
     - Lead Score, Stage, Signals, Touches

## üì¶ What's Included in This Deployment

### Core Files:
- ‚úÖ `app.py` - Main Flask application with TOFU enhancements
- ‚úÖ `chat.py` - AI chatbot with lead qualification system
- ‚úÖ `requirements.txt` - Production dependencies (optimized)
- ‚úÖ `Procfile` - Tells Render how to start the app
- ‚úÖ `runtime.txt` - Specifies Python version
- ‚úÖ `templates/index.html` - Chat interface
- ‚úÖ `info.txt` - PALMS‚Ñ¢ knowledge base

### TOFU Features:
- ‚úÖ 4-tier lead scoring (0-100 points)
- ‚úÖ Smart qualification signals (authority, budget, timeline)
- ‚úÖ Progressive conversation flows
- ‚úÖ Enhanced Google Sheets integration
- ‚úÖ Multi-touch tracking

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Build Fails
- **Check logs** in Render dashboard for specific errors
- **Verify** `requirements.txt` has no syntax errors
- **Ensure** all files are pushed to GitHub

### Issue: OpenAI API Not Working
- **Verify** your `OPENAI_API_KEY` is correct
- **Check** you have credits in your OpenAI account
- **Look** at Render logs for specific OpenAI errors

### Issue: ChromaDB Fails to Initialize
- This is normal on first deployment - it will create the database
- Check Render logs to ensure `info.txt` was loaded properly

### Issue: Google Sheets Not Receiving Data
- **Verify** your Google Apps Script URL in `app.py` is correct
- **Check** the script deployment is set to "Anyone" access
- **Test** the script URL directly in a browser

### Issue: Slow Cold Start
- Render free tier has ~1 minute cold start after inactivity
- Consider upgrading to paid tier for instant availability

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use environment variables** for all sensitive data (API keys, URLs)
2. **Monitor Render logs** regularly for errors
3. **Test locally first** before pushing to production
4. **Keep your OpenAI key secure** - never commit it to GitHub
5. **Check Google Sheets** regularly to ensure data is flowing

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Render logs first
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Test your Google Apps Script independently
4. Ensure your OpenAI account has available credits

**Your deployment is ready! üéâ**

After deploying, your chatbot will be available at your Render URL, and you can update `footer.php` with the new API endpoint.

## Environment Variables Required
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (get from https://platform.openai.com)
- `ALLOW_RESET`: Set to `TRUE` (allows ChromaDB to reset if needed)
- `FLASK_DEBUG`: Set to `False` for production

## After Deployment
1. Your app will be available at: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`
2. Update `footer.php` with the new URL:
   ```javascript
   const API_URL = 'https://your-app-name.onrender.com';
   ```

## Testing the Deployment
1. Visit `https://your-app-name.onrender.com` (should show the chat interface)
2. Test the chat functionality
3. Test the demo form submission

## Troubleshooting
- If ChromaDB fails to initialize, check that `ALLOW_RESET=TRUE` is set
- If OpenAI fails, verify your `OPENAI_API_KEY` is correct and has credits
- Check Render logs for any deployment errors

## Files Modified for Deployment
- `app.py`: Updated to use environment PORT variable
